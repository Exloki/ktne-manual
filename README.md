# Improved manual for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

This is just an improved manual for the game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/),
the original manual can be found at https://www.bombmanual.com/

The manual is hosted at https://ktanemanual.netlify.app/

Currently only has an interactive way to solve the password module.

### I plan to integrate ideas from these other manuals:
